# pitch-sequencing

The idea here is that we can track difference sequences of pitches for different pitchers so we can identify how they should pair pitches together.

Use the atached Jupyter notebook to access the functions developed which enable the analysis of different for pitchers.

The next step that needs to be taken is to develop a platform or widget that allows users to easily access and use these functions regardless of their familiarity with Python as a platform.
