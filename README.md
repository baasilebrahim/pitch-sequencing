# pitch-sequencing

The idea here is that we can track difference sequences of pitches for different pitchers so we can identify how they should pair pitches together. Similarly, if we want to use the analysis done here for advance scouting purposes that is possible. We can come to understand pitcher's tendencies and where they throw pitches when they are executing a given sequence to help with preparation.

Use the atached Jupyter notebook to access the functions developed which enable the analysis of different for pitchers. Additionally, the second half of the notebook demonstrates the predictive power of this data, specifically looking at Whiff Rate induced by a given pitch sequence, across different time periods.

The next step that needs to be taken is to develop a platform or widget that allows users to easily access and use these functions regardless of their familiarity with Python as a platform.
